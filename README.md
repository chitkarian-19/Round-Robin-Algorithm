# Round-Robin-Algorithm
Round Robin Algorithm
         
         In Operating System for running different processes and for the efficient utilization of CPU,
         the system uses RoundRobin Algorithm for increasing the throughput of the Operating System
         
         
   How to Run
         1. Compile the java file present in the src folder named "RoundRobin.java"
             commands: >javac RoundRobin.java
                       >java  RoundRobin
                       
         2. Enter the proccess Lifetime.
         3. Then enter the CPU quantum
         4. Then one by one enter the arrival and burst time for three process and then see the output
